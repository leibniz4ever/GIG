      The Graphical Explorer of GPU Programs (GIG) is used to help
debug CUDA programs. It uses the formal verifier GKLEE, developed
at the University of Utah, to automatically detect many errors
and problems such as race conditions, deadlocks, and bank conflicts.
This is all cleanly integrated into an easy-to use eclipse plug-in.
