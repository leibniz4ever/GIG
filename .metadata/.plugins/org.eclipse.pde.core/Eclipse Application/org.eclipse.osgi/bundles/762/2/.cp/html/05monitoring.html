<h1 id="top">Monitoring Jobs and Systems</h1>
<p>This section describes the features of PTP the enable the developer to monitor activity on target parallel machines, to monitor job status, and to control jobs. 
It will cover the following topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#perspective">System Monitoring perspective</a></li>
<li><a href="#monitors">Monitors view</a></li>
<li><a href="#system">System view</a></li>
<li><a href="#jobs">Active/Inactive Jobs viewa</a></li>
<li><a href="#messages">Messages view</a></li>
<li><a href="#console">Console view</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="perspective">System Monitoring Perspective</h3>

<p>
PTP provides the <b>System Monitoring</b> perspective for job and system monitoring.  To open the System Monitoring perspective,
select <b>Window &gt; Open Perspective &gt; Other ...</b> and choose <b>System Monitoring</b> from the list.</p>

<p>The System Monitoring perspective is divided
into four main areas. On the left side, from top to bottom are the <b><a href="#monitors">Monitors</a></b> view, the <b><a href="#jobs">Active/Inactive Jobs</a></b> views, and the 
<b><a href="#messages">Messages</a></b> and <b><a href="#console">Console</a></b> views. Taking up the entire right side is the <b><a href="#system">System</a></b> view. 
The contents of each view depend on 
the monitor that is currently selected in the Monitors view.

<h2 id="monitors">Monitors View</h2>
<p>The Monitors view shows all systems that are configured for monitoring, and whether monitoring is currently active or not. The Monitors view
has three columns: a Status column that displays an icon for each active monitor, a Connection column that shows the name of the connection used
to connect to the remote system, and a System Type column that shows the type of system being monitored.</p>

<p>Using the toolbar buttons on this view, it is possible to start and stop monitoring a system, request a manual refresh, and add and remove monitors respectively.
It is only possible to have one monitor for each combination of connection name and system type.</p>

<h3 id="system">System View</h3>

The System view provides an overall view of the activity on the target remote system. The view tab will contain the name of the remote system
(as provided by the resource manager). The layout of this view will depend on the configuration of
the target system, but will generally consist of a number of boxes that represent aggregations of computing resources (such as racks). These boxes may in turn 
contain other elements that represent the computing resources (such as nodes). The color of the boxes is used to indicate which jobs are running on the nodes.
<p>
The view currently supports two mouse actions. Hovering over an element in the view will display a tooltip box with information about that element, including
which jobs are associated with the element. Clicking on an element will highlight all associated elements (those with the same color) in the display. This
shows the user where a particular job is running on the system.

<h3 id="jobs">Active/Inactive Jobs Views</h3>

The Active Jobs view shows a list of all the jobs that are running on the system. The exact columns displayed in the view will depend on the capabilities of
the remote system. Each job in the table is assigned a color in the first column. This color corresponds to the colors displayed in the System Monitor view.
Clicking on a row in the table will highlight the row and also the location of the jobs in the System Monitor view.

<p>
Job actions are available by right-clicking on a job in the view. The actions available will depend on the type of job, its state, and the job owner.

<p>
Rows in the table can be sorted by clicking on the column heading. This will cycle though a sort sequence of "ascending", "descending", and none.
Columns can also be removed from the view by right-clicking on the column heading and unselecting the column name.

The Inactive Jobs view is essentially the same as the Active Jobs view, but displays jobs that are not currently running on the system. As these jobs don't
have associated nodes in the System Monitor view, they are not assigned a color.
<p>
Jobs that are launched by the user will initially appear in the Inactive Jobs view with status SUBMITTED. These jobs can be controlled (e.g. canceled)
 by right clicking on the job and selecting an available action. <b>Refresh Job Status</b> can be used to get an immediate update of the job status rather
 than waiting for the next update.

<p>
Once a job has finished executing, it will appear in this view with status COMPLETED. The stdout and stderr from the job can be displayed in
the <a href="#output">Console view</a> by right clicking on the job and
selecting the appropriate action. Completed jobs will remain in the view between Eclipse sessions, so you can leave Eclipse and return at a later time without
losing information about the jobs. If you wish to remove the job from the view (permanently), use the <b>Remove Job Entry</b> action.

<h2 id="output">Console View</h2>
Depending on the functionality of the resource manager, PTP can also display standard output and standard error from the parallel program in the
Console view. As mentioned above, output from batch jobs is only available once the job is completed. However, output from interactive jobs
is generally displayed immediately in the console view (depending on settings in the launch configuration).</p>
