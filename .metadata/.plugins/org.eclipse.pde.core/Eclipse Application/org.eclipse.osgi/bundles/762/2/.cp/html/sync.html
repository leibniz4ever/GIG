<p>Synchronized projects consist of files that are mirrored on the local system as well as on one or more remote systems.
Editing occurs locally and each file is synchronized with the currently active remote system when it is changed, created, or deleted.  
This enables faster interaction with the files
and editor, more CDT editor features since the files are local, and continued interaction for editing etc. if the network
connection is lost.
<p>
<h2 id=prereq>Requirements for Synchronized Projects</h2>
<p>To host a synchronized project, the remote system must support the <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a> distributed version control system.

<h2 id=create>Creating a new Synchronized Project</h2>
<p>To create a new Synchronized Project, first select an appropriate wizard:</p>
Select <b>File > New > Other...</b>
then in the wizard selection dialog, select <b>Remote > Synchronized C/C++ Project</b> or <b>Synchronized Fortran Project</b>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-newproj.png">
<p><br></p>
<p>Or, from the context menu (right-mouse) in the Project Explorer,
select <b>New > Synchronized C/C++ Project</b> or <b>Synchronized Fortran Project</b>
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojContext.png">
<p><br></p>
Now fill out the dialog shown.
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojCreate.png">
<p><br></p>
As for any Eclipse project, give the project name and location, which must be a local directory for a Synchronized Project.
Then give a remote location by specifying a <a href="#connection">connection</a> and remote directory.
Next, specify the project type. Finally, select toolchains to be used for remote and local sites.
Normally, you will select only one toolchain for both, but it is possible to select additional toolchains.
<p>
Select <b>Next</b> to scroll through the remaining pages, which differ based on the selected project types and toolchains.
At some point, you should see the configuration page, which will list a separate build configuration for each toolchain selected earlier.
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojConfig.png">
<p><br></p>
From here, you can configure build properties. (This can also be done after the project is created.)
Note that if you select the same toolchain for both local and remote, only one configuration is shown.
During project creation, this configuration will be duplicated, creating one for local and another for remote.

<h3 id="connection">Creating a remote connection</h3>
On the first wizard page, the <b>New...</b> button can be used to create a new remote connection.
Fill in host name, user, and password (or other authentication information).
Select <b>Finish</b>.  The connection will be tested at this point.
<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-newprojConnection.png">
<p><br></p>

<h2 id="work">Working with a Synchronized Project</h2>
<p>The starting configuration will be for one of the remote toolchains.
Thus, for the most common case (a single remote site to be modified and built), a synchronized project works out-of-the-box.
If the remote location does not exist, it is created. Otherwise, the files in that directory will be synchronized to the local workspace.
Edit the files as you would any local project.
Each time you save a file, it will be synchronized with the remote system.
If you create or delete files, the remote system will be updated appropriately.
</p>
<p>
By default, a synchronized project is configured to build on the same remote host as for synchronization.
To build the project (assuming you have already created a makefile), make sure the project is selected in the <b>Project Explorer</b> view, then click
on the build icon (the icon that looks like a hammer).
</p>
<p>
Synchronization and building are done between the local workspace and the active configuration.
You can change the active configuration by using the "sundial" icon next to the build icon, or build and switch simultaneously using the arrow next to the build icon.
Local configurations have sync disabled initially and build in the Eclipse workspace.
</p>
<p>
You can create configurations to synchronize and build on other remote systems from the <b>C/C++ Build > Synchronize</b> project properties.
To bring up the Synchronize project properties, in the <b>Project Explorer</b> view, select the project and choose <b>Properties</b> from the context
menu (right click).
You can also use these property pages to modify configurations in general. See the CDT documentation for more details.
</p>
<p><img src="images/sync-projProperties.png">

<h2 id="context-menu">Changing sync behavior with the Sync Context Menu</h2>
<p>The sync context menu lets you alter the sync behavior and can be accessed with a right click on a sync project. From this menu, you can turn off automatic sync'ing (sync after saving files and other resource changes) so that syncs only occur on request. This setting is applied to all projects in the workspace. The "Project Auto-Sync Settings" submenu allows you to alter the behavior of automatic sync'ing per project. The next two selections allow you to force an immediate sync of the current project. A "sync all" syncs all configurations of a project. Note that this can be quite slow if your project has several configurations. Prior to a build, files are always updated with a forced sync of only the active configuration, regardless of any settings. This ensures that the build is based on the latest revisions. Another sync may occur after the build to update files, since the build may alter the remote files during compilation. (This sync, however, does respect the user's settings.) See "<a href="#file-filter">Changing which files are synchronized</a>" for information on the "Filter..." option.

<p><img src="images/sync-contextMenu.png">

<h2 id="file-filter">Changing which files are synchronized</h2>
<p>
From the "Filter..." option of the sync context menu, you can change which files are synchronized for the current project. You can also change the default settings for future projects on the "Synchronized Project" preference page. For files and folders, "Exclude Selection" and "Include Selection" shortcut options are also available from the context menu. 
By default, files and directories specifically used by Eclipse are excluded. (Note that these files, such as <code>.project</code> etc.  are normally not visible.)
The "File View" always indicates the currently excluded and included directories and files, while the "Pattern View" always shows the current exclude and include patterns. (The file view is not shown on the preference page.) Each view updates automatically if the other view is changed, so that they are always in agreement. This allows you to see immediately the effect of adding a new pattern. By default, remote files are not shown. Showing remote files may lead to a slower response time while updating views. An error message is printed if the remote is disconnected.

<p>
You can deselect or select directories or files in the File View, which will add the corresponding exclude or include pattern to the pattern view. These are "path" patterns, meaning that directories or files in the specified path are excluded or included. 
Underneath the Pattern View, you can manually enter a path (Enter Path:). You can also enter a regular expression ("regex") that is compared to the project-relative path. The regular expression syntax is that of the Java programming language. An error message is printed if the regular expression is not valid. Finally, you can select "special" patterns from the "Select pattern" drop-down. Currently the only special pattern is one for matching binary files.

<p>
Patterns are applied in the order given in the Pattern View, and new patterns are always placed at the top (highest priority). So a file will be excluded or included based on the first matching pattern, or included if no pattern matches. Use the "Up" and "Down" buttons to change a pattern's priority. If a new pattern is identical to an old pattern and has the same type, the old pattern is removed. Note that it doesn't matter whether the old pattern was an exclude or include pattern, since the new pattern supersedes it.

<h2 id="conversion-wizard">Converting a project to a Synchronized Project</h2>
<p>
The conversion wizard allows you to convert current C/C++ or Fortran projects to synchronized projects. Currently only local projects can be converted. To convert a project right-click in the workspace and select <b>New > Other...</b> In the wizard selection dialog, select <b> Remote > Convert C/C++ or Fortran Project to a Synchronized Project > Next</b>. From this dialog, you can select a project to convert and configure a remote site. See <a href="#connection">Creating a remote connection</a> for details on creating new connections. The selected configurations are duplicated to create a local version and a remote version. Unselected configurations remain as local configurations only. After creating the project, you may want to change the toolchain for the remote configurations. You can do this from <b>Project > Properties > C/C++ Build > Tool Chain Editor</b>. <b>After selecting a toolchain, you must change the current builder back to the "Sync Builder" in order for builds to occur remotely.</b>

<h2 id="merge-conflict">Resolving merge conflicts</h2>
<p>
A "merge conflict" can occur, in general, when merging two different versions of a file into a single version. There may be disagreement, for various reasons, on what the final version should be. For synchronized projects, merge conflicts do not occur during normal use, because the underlying system knows that local file changes are updates to older remote versions, or vice versa. Merge conflicts may occur, however, if files are changed both locally and remotely without an intervening sync, because the next sync may not know how to merge the two versions. (It is a good idea to sync after making remote changes before resuming work in Eclipse.) When a conflict is detected, the following dialog appears:

<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-mergeConflictDialog.png">
<p><br></p>

You can open the merge conflict view from this dialog or from <b>Window > Show View > Other..</b> and then <b>Remote Development > Synchronized Merge View</b>. This view shows a list of conflicting files. (You may need to select the project in Project Explorer if the viewer is empty.) Double-click a file to bring up a "compare editor" where differences can be viewed and conflicts resolved. In this editor, the left pane shows the local file, which has been marked up to show conflicts, and the right pane shows the remote file. The "ancestor" file optionally appears above these two panes and can be toggled on or off using the editor's leftmost icon. The ancestor is the last known version of the file from which both local and remote are derived. Also note that right-clicking the file in the viewer brings up a context menu from which certain options can be selected (discussed below).

<p><br></p>
<p><img src="images/sync-mergeConflictResolve.png">
<p><br></p>

In the compare editor, editing the left pane edits the local version of the file. The compare editor is only for convenience. You can also edit the file from the normal Eclipse text editor. When finished editing, be sure to save the file and then select "Mark as resolved" from the context menu. This version will be copied to the remote site on the next sync. Do the same for each conflicted file. Sync'ing is blocked until all conflicts have been resolved. Instead, the merge-conflict dialog will appear. (Click the checkbox in the merge-conflict dialog to disable it until the merge is resolved.) It is a good idea to sync manually after resolving the merge to push the edits to the remote system.
<p>
After a merge conflict, the local file has markers and annotation added to show the differing content on the local and remote sites. This is useful for editing the file by itself, but not so much for using the compare editor. Select "Reset to version before merge" in the context menu to revert the local file to its prior version. Now the compare editor will show clearly the differences between local and remote.

<h2 id="includes">Remote Include Paths</h2>
<p>At the time of the PTP 5.0 release (June 2011),
 the  mechanism for supporting remote includes in CDT  
 does not work automatically with synchronized projects yet, as it 
 requires some integration with the remote scanner discovery (which discovers what includes/defines 
 are set on the remote system). 

<p>You can currently manually configure remote include files as follows:
<ol>
<li>Open the project properties
<p><br></p></li>
<li>Open the <b>C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols</b> page
<p><br></p></li>
<li>Choose the build configuration you want to use
<p><br></p></li>
<li>Click on <b>GNU C</b> and remove the existing paths
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>Add new paths to the remote include directories using 
 UNC notation <code>//connection_name/usr/include</code> where 'connnection_name' is the name of the connection you specified 
 for the Remote Tools service provider
 <p><br></p>
 For example, to add the include path <code>/usr/include</code> using the connection <code>lincoln.ncsa.uiuc.edu</code> that you
 previously configured, you would use the path <code>//lincoln.ncsa.uiuc.edu/usr/include</code>
 <p><br></p>
</li>
<li>Click OK then OK again. You may be asked if you want to rebuild the index. Click Yes.
</li>
</ol>
